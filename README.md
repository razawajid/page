<h1 align="center"><i>About me</h1>

<p align="center"><i> Cheers,<br/>I'm an old guy (at the end of 30) who likes programming, internet and things like that. I'm doing 96 days of code so far and it's unbelievable what you can learn in this short time.
My next goals are to learn the basics of HTML. First I needed it for scrapping with Python. Later in scrapping- topic, I want to know more about the structure of websites. I want to go deeper into Python. I learned the basics here and on codecademy. At the moment I learn about BeautifulSoup 4 and Tkinter. I want toset up a dedicated server (debian), host some HTML files, and build a custom mail client
a point of the so-called "Freifunk". Other interests include Lockpicking & Graffity. Yee, that far.</i></p>
<p align="center">Why? I'm not sure, I went in a bit by accident. I have an interest in my environment since my childhood. I want to explore my surroundings and learn something about it. At this time there was no internet, but the first programs came up. Programs, apps and the internet are some kind of
"natural environment". Later, I think it became a matter of course.</p>

<p align="center"> Atm, Sololearn is my most important source of knowledge. Sure, you have to practice for yourself, but it's a good source.<br/>try it
